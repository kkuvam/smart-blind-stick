# Smart Blind Stick

The Arduino Smart Blind Stick project aims to create a smart assistive device that enhances the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. By leveraging Arduino's capabilities and various sensors, I had designed and build a blind stick that can detect obstacles, provide audio feedback, and help users navigate their surroundings more effectively.
