# Smart Blind Stick

The Arduino Smart Blind Stick project aims to create a smart assistive device that enhances the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. By leveraging Arduino's capabilities and various sensors, I had designed and build a blind stick that can detect obstacles, provide audio feedback, and help users navigate their surroundings more effectively.

The project utilizes an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure distances and provide audio feedback.

## Learning

- Understand Arduino Basics: Gain a fundamental understanding of Arduino programming and hardware components.
- Learn Sensor Integration: Learn how to integrate and use various sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors) to detect obstacles.
- Implement Audio Feedback: Understand the principles of audio feedback and how to implement it using audio buzzers.
- Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Develop my problem-solving skills by troubleshooting and debugging the smart blind stick.
- Apply Practical Electronics Skills: Apply practical electronics skills to build a functional and reliable assistive device.


## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano)
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- LED or Buzzer (optional, for alerts)


## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)


## Installation and Usage
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Connect your Arduino board to the computer via USB.
- Load the Sketch:
- Open ultrasonic_distance_sensor.ino in the Arduino IDE.
- Check Board and Port Settings:
- Go to Tools → Board and select your Arduino board.
- Go to Tools → Port and select the correct COM port.
- Upload the Code:
- Click the Upload button to flash the code onto your Arduino.
- Monitor the Output:
- Open the Serial Monitor (Tools → Serial Monitor) to view distance measurements.


## How It Works
- The HC-SR04 sensor sends an ultrasonic pulse and measures the time it takes to bounce back from an object.
- The Arduino calculates the distance based on the speed of sound.
- The output is provided in form of beep which becomes closer as the distance reduces.


## Troubleshooting
- No output on the serial monitor? Check the baud rate (usually 9600).
- Incorrect distance readings? Ensure the sensor is connected correctly (VCC, GND, Trig, Echo).
- Upload errors? Check the correct board and port settings in the Arduino IDE.
